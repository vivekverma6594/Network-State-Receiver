# Network-State-Receiver
Simple implementation of Broadcast Receiver to check if the device is connected to the Internet. 
A snackbar at the botton indicates if the device is connected to the internet.
Just implement the NetworkStateReceiverListener interface in your activity and override the onNetworkAvailable and onNetworkUnavailable methods to check for internet connectivity in your application.
